# Homepage
This is a handy and somewhat configurable homepage to easily access your favorite websites.  
No ads, no nonsense, no unprompted major changes (yes, I'm looking at you Mozilla), just your usual ol' homepage.  
This is mostly for my own use, though I uploaded it in case someone might one day get some use out of it.

## JSON
JSON is used to store the websites you wish to access, in a file named "data.json".  
See "websites.json" for the data structure to follow.
